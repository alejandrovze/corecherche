--------------PLAYERS: TRACKS FOR SAMPLE RECORDING AND PLAYBACK

Sample Player N
Needs "Pong0GainWatcher" M4L Device
Set "track identifier" to the number of the track (to be automated in the future)
Default setup: three tracks, 0, 1, 2

This patch checks that the signal is at a sufficient level before triggering recording. 

Can set the external input to be different or the same for each track (default here they are all set to input 1, with the idea of a common sample to be processed differently on each of the three tracks).

--------------TRIGGERS: TRACKS FOR SAMPLE TRIGGERING

Trigger Input N
Each needs Audio2MidiTrigger M4L Device

Set the external input according to which input you want to trigger the corresponding Sample player track. (e.g. here inputs 2, 3, 4 will trigger tracks 0, 1, 2). 



--------------RECORD - SWITCHBOX
Determines which key presses are translated to recording which track. 
Currently set up for up to four different tracks. 

Purple "trigger note" chooses input note. (Use panel on right to press keys and find out which note it corresponds to).

Red "triggered channel" corresponds to the channel to be triggered for recording.

By default, note "65" (keyboard "F") will trigger recording on tracks 0, 1 and 2. 

--------------ROUTERS
One router for each N sample player tracks
Set the track identifier to track that it controls. 

Possible to change pitch shift level to automate pitch shift changes with different amplitude.
